    <h1>About titanosaurus</h1>
    <p>Titanosaurus, literally meaning 'titanic lizard', was named after the mythological Titans.

        Titanosaurus was the first Indian dinosaur to be named and properly described, having been recorded for the first time in 1877. The type species, T. indicus, was named in 1877,[1][2] and the second species, T. blanfordi, was named in 1879.[3] Both species were named by Richard Lydekker.[1][3] T. indicus and T. blanfordi are 70 million years old.</p>
